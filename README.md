# MASS_Thesis

This repository contains the scripts and notebooks used for my Masterâ€™s thesis in the **Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Astrophysics and Space Science (MASS)**.  
The work was carried out at the ** Tor Vergata University of Rome (Italy)** and the **University of Belgrade (Serbia)**.

## Thesis Overview
The goal of the thesis was to **simulate and analyze Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observations of NGC 1068**, a nearby Seyfert II galaxy.  
I used the [**Gammapy**](https://gammapy.org) Python package for high-level gamma-ray astronomy:

- Performed **CTA observation simulations** of NGC 1068.  
- Reconstructed the **spectral energy distribution (SED)** of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056.  
- Transitioned from exploratory **Jupyter notebooks** to reproducible **Python scripts** for the final pipeline.
